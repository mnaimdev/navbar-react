      text: 'CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS defines how elements should be displayed on the screen, in print, or in other media. It allows web developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page.\n\nCSS operates on a cascading principle, which means that styles can be inherited from parent elements and overridden by more specific rules. Selectors are used to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. CSS3, the latest version at the time of my knowledge cutoff date, introduced a wide range of features, including animations, transitions, and flexible box layouts.'
